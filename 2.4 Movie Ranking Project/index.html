<h1>The top 3 movies according to Patrick Barker (and anyone with sense)</h1>
<h2>My favorite movies so far</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Eraserhead</h3>

<p>An atmospheric nightmarescape that plays on existential dread and the fear of succumbing to the demands of fatherhood. No movie does a better job of honestly portraying pre-fatherhood anxiety.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>

 </a> 
<p>Is this the real life or is this just fantasy? What is real? What does it mean to exist and do we? No movie got my young brain thinking of philosophical concepts more than The Matrix.</p>
<h3>Synecdoche New York</h3>

<p>Why do we create? Art immitates life immitates art. What are the limitations of art? In the end is time spent creating worth anything at all? Is living just as much an exercise in futility as creating art?</p>
